**MIT News:** [Water Evaporation WITHOUT Heat](https://news.mit.edu/2023/surprising-finding-light-makes-water-evaporate-without-heat-1031)

Creating water vapor using cool green polarized light has the potential to generate abundant clean water.  Cold SuperThermal Evaporation can dry equipment without heat and blowers. We could dry ourselves and our towels after showering. Most significantly, we could reduce ocean levels by building-up ice on Antarctica.

### Questions:

1. Can the green light beams be reflected across distances, and from space?

2. What techniques can be used to increase the water surface area exposed to the polarized light?

3. At what levels of intensity are there safety issues with the green polarized light?

4. What's the nanometres range for early morning sun?

## Help us Create Kits for Kids

**Cool Light Evaporation (CLEave) Kits for Kids** could use birefringent materials (crystals) with a [faraday rotator](https://youtu.be/17Y82tJDk2o?si=NTd8OrYJcbRvYvld&t=488) for polarizing light.

During cold SuperThermal Evaporation (via the Photomolecular Effect), photons **cleave off clusters of water molecules**

[Gang Chen's team at MIT](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/gchen2%40mit.edu) figured out in 2021. [Learn more](https://news.mit.edu/2023/surprising-finding-light-makes-water-evaporate-without-heat-1031)

## Light Nanometres

**Nanometres (nm)**
Ultraviolet (UV) from 200 to 400 nm - Invisible. Source of skin cancer at noon
Blue from 400 to 500 nm
Green from 500 to 600 nm
Red from 600 to 700 nm
Near infrared (NIR) from 700 to 800 nm
Infrared (IR) from 800 to 1200 nm - Longer wavelength - Polarized with visible red and orange light in mornings and evenings

[Polarized Light Therapy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378512218303888) - Polarized light penetrates further into tissues. Sunlight exposure, especially in the morning when UV radiation is less intense, helps the body produce vitamin D. Adequate levels of vitamin D are associated with a lower risk of several cancers, including colorectal and breast cancer. Polarized light also has an [anti‚Äêinflammatory effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7065605/).

Early morning and evening light is strongly polarized since it reaches the earth's surface at a shallow 90-degree angle from the original path. In addition, the longer path through the atmosphere causes more scattering and greater polarization as photon rotation syncs during transfering of energy to water molecules via [Raman Scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_scattering). &nbsp;More red and orange occur in the morning due to the greater atmospheric scattering of the shorter blue wavelengths. At noon a higher proportion of short wavelength blue light makes it through narrow atmosphere distance, resulting in a full spectrum white appearance.


## Capturing water using a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF)

Discovered at MIT in 2021, porous Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF) can trap water from air by using tiny aluminum-based rods. In March 2023 a 50% efficiency gain was made by adding a linker extension consisting of two carbon atoms.

Does the following article give us liters-per-day to compare with Source.co solar panels?

## Solar panels that condense water from air

Source.co uses solar panels to condense water from air. Used in over 50 countries, the panels have an internal electric fan to move air through a dry desiccant material to produce 4-5 liters of water per panel per day. They're not using MOF or GreenLight, yet. [Source.co](https://www.source.co)


## Water harvesting optimization using multiple technologies

<!--Combining GreenLight evaporation with MOF water capture and Solar Panels for heat and airflow-->

GreenLight Kits for Kids using cool green polarized light could further improve MOF water trapping by increasing the available water vapor. Adding heat and airflow using solar energy could further enhance both the GreenLight evaporation process and MOF water capture. From what I've read previously, Water capture in porous MOF material occurs during the cool of the night. It uses the heat of the day to release the water.
