## Photomolecular Effect - Moving Oceans

Moving water with light and wind allows us to build-up ice on Antarctica, while generating bundant clean water. Using green polarized light we can dry equipment without heat and blowers, and we can dry ourselves and our towels after showering.

### Questions:

Can the green light beams be reflected from space?

What techniques can be used to increase the water surface area exposed to the polarized light?

At what levels of intensity are there safety issues with the light sources?

### Kits for Kids

**Cool Light Evaporation (CLEave) Kits for Kids** could use birefringent materials (crystals) with a faraday rotator for polarized light.  [Details](https://youtu.be/17Y82tJDk2o?si=NTd8OrYJcbRvYvld&t=488)

During cold SuperThermal Evaporation (via the Photomolecular Effect), photons **cleave off clusters of water molecules**

Gang Chen's team at MIT figured out in 2021. [Learn more](https://news.mit.edu/2023/surprising-finding-light-makes-water-evaporate-without-heat-1031)
