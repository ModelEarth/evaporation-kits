## Photomolecular Effect - Moving Oceans

**MIT News:** [Water Evaporate WITHOUT Heat](https://youtu.be/17Y82tJDk2o?si=NTd8OrYJcbRvYvld&t=488)

SuperThermal Evaporation - Moving water with light and wind will allow us to generating bundant clean water. Using green polarized light we can also dry equipment without heat and blowers, and we can dry ourselves and our towels after showering. Most significantly, we can reduce ocean levels by building-up ice onto Antarctica.

### Questions:

1. Can the green light beams be reflected from space?

2. What techniques can be used to increase the water surface area exposed to the polarized light?

3. At what levels of intensity are there safety issues with the light source?

## Help us Create Kits for Kids

**Cool Light Evaporation (CLEave) Kits for Kids** could use birefringent materials (crystals) with a faraday rotator for polarized light.

During cold SuperThermal Evaporation (via the Photomolecular Effect), photons **cleave off clusters of water molecules**

Gang Chen's team at MIT figured out in 2021. [Learn more](https://news.mit.edu/2023/surprising-finding-light-makes-water-evaporate-without-heat-1031)
