## Seawater to Drinking Water in a few minutes

Fast, efficient desalination using narrow tubes with the top sides heated to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The lower side is kept cooler, around 68 degrees. Salt ions collect on the colder side. 

## Capturing water from air using a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF)

Discovered at MIT in 2021, water is captured from air using tiny aluminum rods containing a porous Metal-Organic Framework (MOF). In&nbsp;March 2023, a 50% efficiency gain was made by adding two carbon atoms as a linker extension.  Water is captured during the cool of the night. The heat of the day releases the captured water from the aluminum.

Does the following article give us liters-per-day to compare with Source.co solar panels?

## Solar Panels that Condense Water from Air

Source.co uses solar panels to condense water from air. Used in over 50 countries, the panels have an internal electric fan to move air through a dry desiccant material to produce 4-5 liters of water per panel per day. They're not using MOF, heated tube tops, or polarized green light, yet. [Source.co](https://www.source.co)

## Super-Thermal Water Evaporation WITHOUT Heat

20% of energy use by industry in spent drying equipment with heat and blowers. Cold polarized green light can evaporate water by cleaving sheets of H20 from the water surface, generating clean water with less energy. [More on water cleaving](../).
